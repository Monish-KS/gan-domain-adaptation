# Web Interface Plan for Domain Adaptation Project

This document outlines the plan to create a web application for displaying experiment results, visualizing trends, showing generated images, and potentially allowing interactive model inference for the domain adaptation project.

## 1. Project Assessment and Further Development Areas

The core deep learning experiments for domain adaptation (source-only, fine-tuning, traditional augmentation, and GAN augmentation) are implemented, executed, and their results are systematically saved. From a research and experimentation standpoint, the project appears functionally complete in its current scope.

However, potential areas for further development within the deep learning pipeline itself could include:

*   **Hyperparameter Optimization:** Implementing automated search strategies to find optimal hyperparameters for models and GANs.
*   **Exploring Advanced Architectures:** Investigating more sophisticated GAN models or classifier architectures.
*   **Additional Domain Adaptation Techniques:** Incorporating and comparing other state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods.
*   **Uncertainty Quantification:** Adding measures of confidence to model predictions, which is crucial for real-world applications.
*   **Robustness Analysis:** Evaluating model performance under various data perturbations or adversarial attacks.

These are typically next steps in a research project to further improve performance or understanding. For the immediate task, the focus is on displaying the existing results through a web interface.

## 2. Proposed Web Interface Plan

**Goal:** Create a web application to display experiment results, visualize trends, show generated images, and potentially allow interactive model inference.

**Key Requirements:**

*   **Results Dashboard:** Display accuracy, classification reports, and other metrics from the individual JSON files.
*   **Comparative Analysis:** Allow users to compare the performance of different scenarios (Source Only, Fine-Tune, GAN Augmentation, Traditional Augmentation) and varying `n_samples` (10, 100, 1000) through interactive charts.
*   **GAN Image Gallery:** Showcase the images generated by the GANs for different epochs.
*   **Interactive Inference (Optional but Recommended):** Provide an interface where a user can upload an image (e.g., an SVHN digit) and get a real-time prediction from a selected, trained classifier model. This demonstrates "actual use."

### High-Level Architecture

    A[User Browser] -->|HTTP/S Requests| B(Frontend: React Application)
    B -->|API Calls (JSON)| C(Backend: Python Flask/FastAPI)
    C -->|Reads & Parses| D[Experiment Results: JSON files]
    C -->|Serves Static Files| E[Generated Images: .png files]
    C -->|Loads & Runs Inference| F[Trained Models: .pth files]
    F -->|Predictions| C
```

*   **Frontend:** A **React** application. This will handle displaying data, charts, and user interactions.
*   **Backend:** A Python web framework (e.g., Flask or FastAPI) will serve as the API layer. It will be responsible for:
    *   Reading and parsing the experiment result **JSON files**.
    *   Serving the static GAN-generated image files.
    *   Loading the trained PyTorch classifier models (`.pth` files).
    *   Providing API endpoints for the frontend to request experiment data, images, and perform model inference.
*   **Existing Data:** The current `experiments/` and `outputs/` directories will be leveraged as the data source for results, images, and trained models.

### Detailed Implementation Plan

1.  **Project Setup:**
    *   Create a new directory, e.g., `web_interface/`, to house the web application.
    *   Inside `web_interface/`, create subdirectories for `backend/` and `frontend/`.

2.  **Backend Development (`web_interface/backend/`):**
    *   **Initialize Flask/FastAPI Application:** Set up a basic web server.
    *   **API Endpoints:**
        *   `/api/experiments/summary`: Returns a high-level summary of all experiments by aggregating data from JSON files.
        *   `/api/experiments/<experiment_id>/results`: Returns detailed results for a specific experiment (from its JSON file).
        *   `/api/images/gan/<experiment_id>/<epoch_id>.png`: Serves GAN-generated images.
        *   `/api/predict`: Accepts an image upload, loads a specified model, performs inference, and returns the prediction (e.g., digit class and confidence).
    *   **Model Loading & Inference:** Implement functions to load the `.pth` model files and run predictions using PyTorch.
    *   **Data Parsing:** Write utilities to read and parse the JSON files containing experiment results.

3.  **Frontend Development (`web_interface/frontend/`):**
    *   **Initialize React Application:** Set up a new React project (e.g., using Create React App or Vite).
    *   **Component Structure:** Design React components for:
        *   A dashboard displaying overall experiment summaries.
        *   Detailed experiment views with charts and classification reports.
        *   A GAN image gallery.
        *   An interactive inference component for image upload and prediction display.
    *   **Styling:** Use CSS or a CSS-in-JS library for styling.
    *   **Data Fetching:** Use `fetch` or `axios` to interact with the backend API.
    *   **Charting Library:** Integrate a React-compatible charting library (e.g., Recharts, Nivo, Chart.js with react-chartjs-2) to visualize accuracy trends and comparisons.

4.  **Integration:**
    *   Ensure the React frontend can communicate correctly with the Python backend API (handle CORS if necessary during development).
    *   Configure the backend to serve the built React application's static files in production.

5.  **Deployment (Future Consideration):**
    *   Containerize the application using Docker for easy deployment.
